**THIS IS A WORKBOOK OF SORTS**

It reflects my efforts to complete all the assignments for the CS50's Introduction to AI with Python from 2023. 

The link to course materials are here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2023/

They might be copyrighted but _they are free as of November 5, 2023._

**BIG DISCLAIMER**

I clearly haven't written all of the code in these files. What I have written is under "projects" in each week, but even there I'd say the majority of the code was provided. 

**How can you tell my code from the others?**

Starting with week3, I've committed files in a way that shows the work I've done.

For the weeks prior where I forgot to initialize a git repo, mostly from the excessive comments I've put in above the code belonging to me.

If you care to know for certain, you can check the code distribution for each assigment and see what I wrote vs what was already given.
